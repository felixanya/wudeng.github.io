## your body language may shape who you are | Amy Cuddy

Our body changes our minds,
...and our minds change our hebavior,
...and our behavior changes our outcomes.

## 5 second rule | mel robbins

The moment you feel yourself hesitate (when you know you should do something) start counting backward 5-4-3-2-1, then GO. The Rule is a proven, form of metacognition. When you use it, you shift mental gears, interrupt your habit of overthinking and awaken your pre-frontal cortex – making change easy. The rule acts as a “starting ritual” that breaks bad habits and triggers positive new behavior change.

这招对小朋友也管用，宝宝玩滑滑梯不下来，大人倒数3,2,1，然后就下来了：）

- DECEPTION IS A COOPERATIVE ACT

watch the face
    - Fear: eyebrows up, eye wide, jaw open, lips stretched

    - Disgust: scrunched nose, raised cheeks, raised upper lip
    - Happiness: crow's-feet and narrowed eyelids
    - Contempt: asymmetric; one lip corner pulled back and in
    - Surprise: eyebrows up, eyes wide, mouth open briefly
    - Anger: eyebrows down, lips narrowed and pulled in tight
body
words
vocal tone

Clues:
- Micro-expressions
- Squelched Expressions
- Reliable Muscle Patterns
- Blink  Rate
- Pupil Dilation
- Tears: take note of tears, but don’t let yourself be swayed by them
- Asymmetrical Expressions
- Timing
- Duration
- INTUITION

Five Steps To the Truth：BASIC
- Baseline Behavior: Obtain a reliable reference point to use for measuring changes in behavior.
- Ask Open-ended Questions: Obtain unlimited information through expanded verbal replies and facial and behavioral
slips, avoiding simple “yes” or “no” questions
- Study the Clusters: Determine the subject’s state of mind by synthesizing facial, behavioral, and verbal clues
- Intuit the Gap: Keeping your instincts in mind, identify and fill in the hole
    - statement gaps
    - logic gaps
    - behavior gaps
    - emotion gaps
- Confirm: Test your hunches and move toward a conclusion.

> A key to eliciting truthful responses, especially in an interview or interrogation setting, is to be non-confrontational. Ask people to explain their version of events, without appearing judgmental, by using phrases such as “What made you…?” instead of the blunt “Why?” By removing the pressure, asking open-ended questions, and showing a willingness to hear an explanation, you will be more likely to get a truthful account.

> Deceptive stories are more likely than true stories to be told with strict chronology.
These introductory details will often be true; they are included to boost credibility and distract from the falsified main event.
Liars also find it easier to tell made-up stories in chronological order, so they can keep the details of their stories straight.

> When ask questions that makes it clear you are in possesion of facts he has't given you
the guilty response may confirm the fact or begin to confess, while the truthful response
is to correct errors in your story.


《间谍同盟》里面，麦克斯怀疑妻子玛丽安是双面间谍，在一次聚会上看到一个老头跟妻子在谈话，老头看到他来了就准备离开，
妻子告诉他老头是珠宝商，过来推销胸针的，他追上去拉住老头，并没有说话，老头看着他说，“看来尊夫人改变主意了”，这时候麦克斯的回答很机智，
他说：“你是说耳环的事？”，结果老头说：“我是说胸针，如果你要耳环，我也可以给你些折扣。”。老头没有露陷。妻子的真实身份依然扑朔迷离。

## 克服拖延症

克服拖延症的关键在于，不要一开始就用复杂的东西吓到大脑，比如我要写一本书，我要跑5000米，我要做50个俯卧撑等等
要说服大脑做一件事情，得是很简单的事情。比如写几个句子，慢跑个200米，做两个俯卧撑。只要你开始了，就会慢慢变成习惯。
任务分解，时间分解都是这样：不要一开始就用非常难的东西吓住大脑以至于要巨大的勇气来开始。
