Our body changes our minds,
...and our minds change our hebavior,
...and our behavior changes our outcomes.

fake it until you make it

fake it til you become it

5 second rule: mel robbins

The moment you feel yourself hesitate (when you know you should do something) start counting backward 5-4-3-2-1, then GO. The Rule is a proven, form of metacognition. When you use it, you shift mental gears, interrupt your habit of overthinking and awaken your pre-frontal cortex – making change easy. The rule acts as a “starting ritual” that breaks bad habits and triggers positive new behavior change.
